# DeFi AI Agent Starter Code

This repository demonstrates how to set up and run multiple Fetch.AI agents on the AgentVerse platform, which interact with a local agent to make decisions on whether to hold or sell a long-term crypto asset. The decisions are based on a combination of FGI (Fear and Greed Index) analysis and coin sentiment analysis.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the code up and running:

1. Navigate to the `agents/` folder and open the `README.md` file. Follow the setup instructions outlined there.
2. Create an API key for the ASI1-LLM model.
3. Set the API key in the `.env` file located in the root directory of the repository.
4. Run the main script (`main.py`) to start the system and check if it works properly.

## Additional Resources

If you encounter any issues or need further guidance, refer to the official [Fetch.AI Documentation](https://fetch.ai/docs) for detailed information.

Happy coding and good luck with your DeFi project!
